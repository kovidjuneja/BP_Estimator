# Brief Overview
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

This project aimed to develop a machine learning model for accurate cuffless blood pressure assessment, comparing it with the standard Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) model. We utilized LSTM for capturing the temporal dependence of blood pressure and CNN to extract key features for effective model training.

# Model 
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

The model comprises three phases. The first phase includes three convolutional layers with 32, 64, and 128 filters, each with a stride of 3. The second phase features two LSTM layers, each with 64 units. The third phase consists of a dense layer with 60 neurons.
# Results

The model achieved a correlation coefficient of 0.89 and a Root Mean Square Error of 8.9, while the standard PINN model had a correlation coefficient of 0.95 and a Root Mean Square Error of 5.3.
